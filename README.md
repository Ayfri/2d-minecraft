# 2d-Minecraft
This is a 2d-game made in TypeScript with the PIXI.js library and WebPack.

This game does not have a site where to play it although you can download the files and launch it locally.

### How to launch it locally
Run the `start` script (in the `package.json`) then open the `index.html` file (in the `out` dir).

### Features
For the moment you can only add dirt blocks on the screen.
