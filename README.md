# 2d-Minecraft
This is a 2d-game made in TypeScript with the PIXI.js library and WebPack.

This game does not have a site where to play it although you can download the files and launch it locally.

### How to launch it locally
Run the `start` script (in the `package.json`) then open the [this link](http://localhost:3000/index.html), it will open the `index.html` file from the `out` folder but in a local server so it can loads the images.

### Features
You can place blocks with the left click.
You can change block selected with the 1-9 keys (for now there is only the dirt block and the stone block).

You can also place air blocks with the Â² key.
